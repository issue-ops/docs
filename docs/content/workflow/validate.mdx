The validation step is where you can perform any checks to ensure that the
request is valid. This is a great place to check for things like:

Inputs for drop-down fields are one of the available options

Inputs for text fields are in the correct format

Inputs for checkboxes are valid

Validation should be done early and often! After a request is initially
validated, there is nothing stopping a user from editing the issue and
submitting it with invalid inputs. Consider re-running validation logic any time
the following events happen:

The issue is created

The issue body is edited

The issue is closed and reopened

The request is submitted for provisioning/creation

After a request is validated successfully, it's helpful to provide a summary of
the actions that will be taken when the user submits the request. However, if
you have good validation logic in place, you can probably remove this step and
move straight to requesting approval after the issue is created. However youâ€™ll
still need to consider how to handle situations such as an admin approving the
request and the user updating the issue body (this is simple to do by checking
the comment timestamps).
