The caption component can be used to append a caption to images used in
documentation.

## Usage

`Caption` is a [shortcode](https://mdxjs.com/blog/shortcodes), meaning it's
globally available in all `.md` and `.mdx` files. So you can use the `Caption`
component in any `.md` or `.mdx` file without importing it.

## Example

```jsx live
<Box style={{ display: 'flex', alignItems: 'center', flexDirection: 'column' }}>
  <img
    alt=""
    src="https://brand.github.com/assets/images/brand-assets/octocat.png"
    style={{
      width: 400,
      alignItems: 'center'
    }}
  />
  <Caption>Mona the octocat.</Caption>
</Box>
```

<Note variant="warning">

Be sure to provide enough detail in your caption so users with assistive
technology have adequate context. An empty alt tag `alt=""` should be used on
the `img` in cases where the caption describes the image, thus making the image
decorative in purpose.
