## Overview

Once an issue has been parsed, it can be validated against any rules that you
require. When used in public repositories, issue form templates do enforce some
[validation rules](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/syntax-for-githubs-form-schema#keys)
such as required fields, selection options, and more. However, you may have
additional needs that apply to your specific use case. For example, if you are
creating an IssueOps workflow for users to request membership to GitHub teams,
the issue form template is not able to validate if a value provided by a user is
in fact a team in your organization.

The [`issue-ops/validator`](https://github.com/issue-ops/validator) action takes
the parsed output of the issue body and validates it against the issue form
template and any custom rules you define.

<Note variant="danger">

After a request is initially validated, there is nothing stopping a user from
editing the issue and submitting it with invalid inputs. You should run your
validation logic any time the following events occur:

- The issue is created
- The issue body is edited
- The issue is closed and reopened
- The request is submitted for provisioning/creation

</Note>

### Basic validation

The most basic validation compares each input field to the rules specified in
your issue form template and, if any are violated, comments with an error
message.

```yaml
- name: Validate Issue
  id: validate
  uses: issue-ops/validator@vX.X.X
  with:
    issue-form-template: example-request.yml
    parsed-issue-body: ${{ steps.parse.outputs.json }}
```

For example, if you have an input field for users to select the visibility of
their new repository, you can specify that the field is required and only one
option can be chosen.

```yaml
- type: dropdown
    id: visibility
    attributes:
      label: Repository Visibility
      description: The visibility of the repository.
      multiple: false
      options:
        - private
        - public
    validations:
      required: true
```

When run against an issue submitted with this template, the validator will
comment on the issue with an error message if any of the following occur:

- The field is empty
- The field is missing from the issue body
- An option other than `private` or `public` is present

### Custom validation

For each form field, you can also specify custom validation logic. This is done
using several files in your repository:

- The validator configuration file (`.github/validator/config.yml`)
- One or more validator scripts (`.github/validator/<script-name>.js`)

#### Configuration file

This file defines the mapping of validator scripts to form fields. For example,
if your issue form has input fields named `Read Team` and `Write Team`, you can
specify a validator script (`check_team_exists.js`) to run against those fields.

```yaml
validators:
  - field: read_team
    script: check_team_exists
  - field: write_team
    script: check_team_exists
```

#### Validator scripts

<Note>
  If you want to run custom validators that access GitHub APIs, you will need to
  provide a value for the `github-token` input. This is another good scenario
  for GitHub App authentication!
</Note>

Validator scripts are run on the associated fields in the configuration file.
The script must specify a default export of a function with the following
behavior:

- Accept inputs of the following types:
  - `string` (Input and Textarea)
  - `string[]` (Dropdown)
  - `{ label: string; required: boolean }` (Checkboxes)
- Return `'success'` for successful validation
- Return an error message (`string`) for unsuccessful validation

The following is an example of a validator script that checks if a team exists.
This can also be found in the
[`issue-ops/validator` repository](https://github.com/issue-ops/validator/blob/main/.github/validator/team.js).

```js
module.exports = async (field) => {
  if (typeof field !== 'string') return 'Field type is invalid'

  const { getOctokit } = require('@actions/github')
  const core = require('@actions/core')
  const octokit = getOctokit(core.getInput('github-token', { required: true }))

  try {
    await octokit.rest.teams.getByName({
      org: process.env.ORGANIZATION ?? '',
      team_slug: field
    })

    core.info(`Team '${field}' exists`)
    return 'success'
  } catch (error) {
    if (error.status === 404) {
      core.error(`Team '${field}' does not exist`)
      return `Team '${field}' does not exist`
    }
  }
}
```

## New repository request

Recall from the
[issue form template](https://github.com/issue-ops/docs/blob/main/new-repository-request-example/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/new-repository-request.yml)
that the new repository request expects the following inputs:

| Input           | Required           | Options             |
| --------------- | ------------------ | ------------------- |
| Repository Name | :white_check_mark: |                     |
| Visibility      | :white_check_mark: | `private`, `public` |
| Read Team       | :white_check_mark: |                     |
| Write Team      | :white_check_mark: |                     |
| Auto Init       | :white_check_mark: | `true`, `false`     |
| Topics          | :x:                |                     |

Since the _Visibility_ and _Auto Init_ inputs must be one of several predefined
values, they can be handled by basic validation. The other fields, however, must
meet additional requirements:

| Field           | Requirement                                                |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Repository Name | Must not be an existing repository                         |
| Read Team       | Must be a team in the organization                         |
| Write Team      | Must be a team in the organization                         |
| Topics          | Must be a list of 20 or fewer                              |
|                 | Each topic must be lowercase                               |
|                 | Each topic must be 50 or fewer characters                  |
|                 | Each topic must contain only letters, numbers, and hyphens |

### Create a configuration file

In order to configure custom validation, first create a configuration file in
the repository.

**File path:** `.github/validator/config.yml`

```yaml
validators:
  - field: repository_name
    script: repo_doesnt_exist
  - field: read_team
    script: team_exists
  - field: write_team
    script: team_exists
  - field: topics
    script: topics_valid
```

### Create validator scripts

The following scripts can be used to validate the new repository request.

#### `.github/validator/repo_doesnt_exist.js`

```js
module.exports = async (field) => {
  if (typeof field !== 'string') return 'Field type is invalid'

  const { getOctokit } = require('@actions/github')
  const core = require('@actions/core')
  const octokit = getOctokit(core.getInput('github-token', { required: true }))

  try {
    // This should throw a 404 error
    await octokit.rest.repos.get({
      org: '<org-name>',
      repo: field
    })

    core.error(`Repository '${field}' already exists`)
    return `Repository '${field}' already exists`
  } catch (error) {
    if (error.status === 404) {
      core.info(`Repository '${field}' does not exist`)
      return 'success'
    }
  }
}
```

#### `.github/validator/team_exists.js`

```js
module.exports = async (field) => {
  if (typeof field !== 'string') return 'Field type is invalid'

  const { getOctokit } = require('@actions/github')
  const core = require('@actions/core')
  const octokit = getOctokit(core.getInput('github-token', { required: true }))

  try {
    await octokit.rest.teams.getByName({
      org: process.env.ORGANIZATION ?? '',
      team_slug: field
    })

    core.info(`Team '${field}' exists`)
    return 'success'
  } catch (error) {
    if (error.status === 404) {
      core.error(`Team '${field}' does not exist`)
      return `Team '${field}' does not exist`
    }
  }
}
```

#### `.github/validator/topics_valid.js`

For details about the requirements for repository topics, see
[About topics](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/classifying-your-repository-with-topics#about-topics).

```js
module.exports = async (field) => {
  if (typeof field !== 'string') return 'Field type is invalid'

  const topics = field.split(/[\r\n]+/)

  if (topics.length > 20)
    return `There are ${request.topics.length} topics (max: 20)`

  const invalidTopics = []
  for (const topic of topics) {
    if (
      topic !== topic.toLowerCase() ||
      topic.length > 50 ||
      !topic.match(/^[a-z0-9-]+$/)
    )
      invalidTopics.push(topic)
  }

  if (invalidTopics.length > 0)
    return `The following topics are invalid: ${JSON.stringify(invalidTopics)}`
}
```

### Update the workflow

Now that issue validation has been configured, you can add it as a step to your
workflow. Additional updates are noted with comments.

```yaml
name: Issue Opened/Edited/Reopened

on:
  issues:
    types:
      - opened
      - edited
      - reopened

jobs:
  new-repository-request:
    name: New Repository Request
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    if: contains(github.event.issue.labels.*.name, 'issueops:new-repository')

    # Since the validation step involves adding comments to issues, you will
    # need to give it write permissions. If you are using a GitHub App to call
    # other GitHub APIs, you will also need to add the appropriate permissions.
    permissions:
      contents: read
      id-token: write
      issues: write

    steps:
      # Always remove the validated/submitted labels first! This ensures that
      # the validation logic runs any time the issue body is edited. It also
      # ensures the issue must be re-submitted after editing.
      - name: Remove Labels
        id: remove-label
        uses: issue-ops/labeler@vX.X.X
        with:
          action: remove
          issue_number: ${{ github.event.issue.number }}
          labels: |
            issueops:validated
            issueops:submitted

      # If your validation script checks things beyond the scope of the
      # repository it is running in, you will need to create a GitHub App and
      # generate an installation access token in your workflow.
      - name: Get App Token
        id: token
        uses: actions/create-github-app-token@vX.X.X
        with:
          app_id: ${{ secrets.MY_GITHUB_APP_ID }}
          private_key: ${{ secrets.MY_GITHUB_APP_PEM }}
          owner: ${{ github.repository_owner }}

      - name: Checkout
        id: checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@vX.X.X

      # Install Node.js so the workflow can add npm packages that are used by
      # the custom validator scripts (e.g. '@octokit/rest').
      - name: Setup Node.js
        id: setup-node
        uses: actions/setup-node@vX.X.X
        with:

          cache: npm

      # Install NPM packages needed by the validator scripts.
      - name: Install Packages
        id: npm
        run: npm ci

      - name: Parse Issue
        id: parse
        uses: issue-ops/parser@vX.X.X
        with:
          body: ${{ github.event.issue.body }}
          issue-form-template: new-repository-request.yml

      # Add a step to validate the issue.

          parsed-issue-body: ${{ steps.parse.outputs.json }}

      # Add a label to mark the request as validated.
      - if: ${{ steps.validate.outputs.result == 'success' }}
        name: Add Validated Label
        id: add-label
        uses: issue-ops/labeler@vX.X.X
        with:
          action: add
          issue_number: ${{ github.event.issue.number }}
          labels: |
            issueops:validated
```
