## Overview

When a new issue is opened, before any action can be taken on it, you should
parse its contents and turn it into a machine-readable format. The
[`issue-ops/parser`](https://github.com/issue-ops/parser) action does this by
comparing the body of the issue with the original issue form template. This way,
you can directly reference issue form fields without having to parse the body
yourself with regular expressions. This action provides specific output formats
based on the `type` property of the input.

| Input type   | Example parsed output                               |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `input`      | `"octorepo"`                                        |
| `textarea`   | `"This is a description!\n\nIt is multiline, too!"` |
| `dropdown`   | `["octocat", "issueops"]`                           |
| `checkboxes` | `{ "selected": ["Yes"], "unselected": ["No"] }`     |

Depending on how you're processing the input data, different types may be more
helpful than others! Based on the issue form template and the contents of the
issue itself, the `json` output will look similar to the following:

```json
{
  "the_name_of_the_thing": "this-thing",
  "the_nickname_of_the_thing": "thing",
  "the_color_of_the_thing": ["blue"],
  "the_shape_of_the_thing": ["square"],
  "the_sounds_of_the_thing": ["re", "mi"],
  "the_topics_about_the_thing": [],
  "the_description_of_the_thing": "This is a description.\n\nIt has lines.",
  "the_notes_about_the_thing": "- Note\n- Another note\n- Lots of notes",
  "the_code_of_the_thing": "const thing = new Thing()\n\nthing.doThing()",
  "the_string_method_of_the_code_of_the_thing": "thing.toString()",
  "is_the_thing_a_thing": {
    "selected": ["Yes"],
    "unselected": ["No"]
  },
  "is_the_thing_useful": {
    "selected": ["Sometimes"],
    "unselected": ["Yes", "No"]
  },
  "read_team": "IssueOps-Demo-Readers",
  "write_team": "IssueOps-Demo-Writers"
}
```

Once an issue has been parsed, the next step is to
[validate](/states-transitions/validate) the contents to make sure the request
isn't missing data, doesn't contain invalid data, and can be processed by your
workflow.

## New repository request

### Issue form template

The new repository worklow starts off with the following issue form template.

```yaml
name: New Repository Request
description: Submit a request to create a new GitHub repository
title: '[Request] New Repository'
labels:
  - issueops:new-repo

body:
  - type: markdown
    attributes:
      value:
        Welcome to GitHub! Please fill out the information below to request a
        new repository. Once submitted, your request will be reviewed by the
        IssueOps team. If approved, the repository will be created and you will
        be notified via a comment on this issue.
  - type: input
    id: name
    attributes:
      label: Repository Name
      description: The name of the repository you would like to create.
      placeholder: octorepo
    validations:
      required: true
  - type: dropdown
    id: visibility
    attributes:
      label: Repository Visibility
      description: The visibility of the repository.
      multiple: false

      description: The GitHub Team that will get read access to the repository.
      placeholder: octocat-readers
    validations:
      required: true
  - type: input
    id: write-team
    attributes:
      label: Write Team
      description: The GitHub Team that will get write access to the repository.
      placeholder: octocat-writers
    validations:
      required: true
  - type: dropdown
    id: auto-init
    attributes:
      label: Auto Init
      description: Select `true` to initialize the repository with a `README`.
      multiple: false
      options:
        - 'true'
        - 'false'
    validations:
      required: true
  - type: textarea
    id: topics
    attributes:
      label: Topics
      description:
        (Optional) A list of topics to add to the repository. Separate each
        topic with a new line.
      placeholder: |
        octocat
        octodog
    validations:
      required: false
```

When a user submits a request for a new repository, the issue form will look
something like this:

<ImageContainer>
  <Box as="form">
    <FormControl>
      <FormControl.Label>Add a title</FormControl.Label>
      <TextInput
        required={true}
        block={true}
        disabled={true}
        value={'[Request] New Repository'}
      />
    </FormControl>
    Welcome to GitHub! Please fill out the information below to request a new repository.
    Once submitted, your request will be reviewed by the IssueOps team. If approved,

### GitHub Actions workflow

Creating an issue will kick off the start of the IssueOps process. However, in
order to do anything with the request, we need to parse the issue body and
extract the information we need to get approval and create a repository.

<Note>Check the workflow comments for useful tips!</Note>

```yaml
name: Issue Opened/Edited/Reopened

# At minimum, the issue body should be parsed any time an issue is opened,
# edited, or reopened. This ensures that the most up to date information is
# validated.
on:
  issues:
    types:
      - opened
      - edited
      - reopened

jobs:
  new-repo-request:
    name: New Repo Request
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Assign labels for different types of requests, and use those labels to
    # trigger different workflows, jobs, and steps.
    if: contains(github.event.issue.labels.*.name, 'issueops:new-repo')

    # Initially, this workflow only needs permissions to read issues. This will
    # be expanded later as we build additional functionality.
    permissions:
      issues: write

    steps:
      # Get the repository contents. This lets the workflow reference files in
      # the repository such as custom validation scripts.
      - name: Checkout
        id: checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@vX.X.X

      # Parse the issue body.
      - name: Parse Issue
        id: parser
        uses: issue-ops/parser@vX.X.X
        with:
          body: ${{ github.event.issue.body }}
          issue-form-template: new-repo-request.yml

      - name: Output the JSON
        id: output
        run: echo ${{ steps.parser.outputs.json }}
```

## Next steps

At this point, our issue has successfully transitioned into the `Parsed` state.
This means that we have a machine-readable representation of the request that
can be further processed by our workflows. However, we don't know if the request
actually contains valid information! The next transition involves validating the
parsed request against a set of rules to make sure it's ready to be processed.
