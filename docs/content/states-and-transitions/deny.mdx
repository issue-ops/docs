## Overview

In the `Denied` state, we know that the issue has been denied and there is no
further action to take. This is one of the first states in the workflow where we
can perform an _unguarded transition_.

In our repository workflow, a request is transitioned to the `Denied` state when
an authorized user comments on the request with `.deny`. However, immediately
after reaching this state, we want to close the issue (moving it to the `Closed`
state). This is called an _unguarded transition_ because there is no condition
that must be met before the transition occurs.

The actual implementation of this transition is up to you! There are a few
recommendations to keep in mind:

- Communication to users is always helpful! Consider leaving a comment on the
  issue to let the user know that their request has been denied and what steps,
  if any, they can take next.
- Even after an issue is closed, users can interact with it. If you want to
  prevent this, you can
  [lock the issue](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/moderating-comments-and-conversations/locking-conversations).
- Labels are a great way to organize issues. Consider adding a label to the
  issue to indicate that it has been denied.
- When closing an issue, choosing an appropriate reason is useful for future
  reporting. For denied requests, closing an issue as `completed` may be
  misleading. Consider `not_planned` instead.

## New repository request

When a new repository request is denied, we want to close the issue and leave a
comment for the user. We should also add an appropriate label so we know the
request was closed as denied.

```yaml
# This job is responsible for handling denied requests.
deny:
  name: Deny Request
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest

  # Only run after validation has completed.
  needs: validate

  steps:
    - name: Deny Command
      id: deny
      uses: github/command@vX.X.X
      with:
        allowed_contexts: issue
        allowlist: octo-org/approvers
        allowlist_pat: ${{ secrets.MY_TOKEN }}
        command: .deny

    # Comment on the issue to let the user know their request was denied.
    - if: ${{ steps.deny.outputs.continue == 'true' }}
      name: Post Comment
      id: comment
      uses: peter-evans/create-or-update-comment@vX.X.X
      with:
        issue-number: ${{ github.event.issue.number }}
        body:
          ':no_entry_sign: This request has been denied! This issue will be
          closed shortly.'

    # Close the issue.
    - if: ${{ steps.deny.outputs.continue == 'true' }}
      name: Close Issue
      id: close
      run: gh issue close ${{ github.event.issue.number }} --reason not_planned
```
