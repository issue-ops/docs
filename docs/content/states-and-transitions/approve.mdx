## Overview

In the `Approved` state, we know that the issue has been approved and we can
begin processing it. This is one of the first states in the workflow where we
can perform an _unguarded transition_.

In our repository workflow, a request is transitioned to the `Approved` state
when an authorized user comments on the request with `.approve`. However,
immediately after reaching this state, we know we can create the repository and
close the issue (moving it to the `Closed` state). This is called an _unguarded
transition_ because there is no condition that must be met before the transition
occurs.

The actual implementation of this transition is up to you! There are a few
recommendations to keep in mind:

- Communication to users is always helpful! Consider leaving a comment on the
  issue to let the user know that their request has been approved and what is
  going to happen next. Or, comment on the issue with a summary of the changes
  that have taken place.
- Even after an issue is closed, users can interact with it. If you want to
  prevent this, you can
  [lock the issue](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/moderating-comments-and-conversations/locking-conversations).
- Labels are a great way to organize issues. Consider adding a label to the
  issue to indicate that it has been approved.
- When closing an issue, choosing an appropriate reason is useful for future
  reporting. For approved requests, closing an issue as `not_planned` may be
  misleading. Consider `completed` instead.

## New repository request

When a new repository request is approved, we need to do the following:

1. Create the repository
1. Comment on the issue
1. Close the issue

```yaml
# This job is responsible for handling approved requests.
deny:
  name: Approve Request
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest

  # Only run after validation has completed.
  needs: validate

  steps:
    - name: Approve Command
      id: approve
      uses: github/command@vX.X.X
      with:
        allowed_contexts: issue
        allowlist: octo-org/approvers
        allowlist_pat: ${{ secrets.MY_TOKEN }}
        command: .approve

    # Create the repository.
    - if: ${{ steps.approve.outputs.continue == 'true' }}
      name: Create Repository
      id: create
      uses: actions/github-script@vX.X.X
      with:
        github-token: ${{ secrets.MY_TOKEN }}
        script: |
          const request = JSON.parse('${{ needs.validate.outputs.request }}')
          await github.rest.repos.createInOrg({
            org: '${{ github.repository_owner }}',
            name: request.name,
          })

    # Comment on the issue to let the user know their request was denied.
    - if: ${{ steps.approve.outputs.continue == 'true' }}
      name: Post Comment
      id: comment
      uses: peter-evans/create-or-update-comment@vX.X.X
      with:
        issue-number: ${{ github.event.issue.number }}
        body:
          ':tada: This request has been approved! Your repository has been
          created.'

    # Close the issue.
    - if: ${{ steps.approve.outputs.continue == 'true' }}
      name: Close Issue
      id: close
      run: gh issue close ${{ github.event.issue.number }} --reason completed
```
