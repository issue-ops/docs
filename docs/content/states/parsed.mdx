## Definition

The `Parsed` state is usually the next immediate state after `Created`. In this
state, the issue body has been read and converted to machine-readable JSON. The
issue body is now available for further processing.

## Example transitions

### Validate

The parsed issue body can now be validated against the issue form template and
any custom rules that you require. Issue form templates do include some
validation rules such as required fields, selection options, and more. However,
you may have additional validation rules that apply to your specific use case.
For example, issue form templates are not able to validate if a value provided
by a user is a valid team in your GitHub organization.

The [`issue-ops/validator`](https://github.com/issue-ops/validator) action takes
the parsed output of the issue body and validates it against the issue form
template and any custom rules you define.

```yaml
- name: Validate Issue
  id: validate
  uses: issue-ops/validator@vX.X.X
  with:
    issue-form-template: example-request.yml
    parsed-issue-body: ${{ steps.parse.outputs.json }}
```

<Note>
  If you want to run custom validators that access GitHub APIs, you will need to
  provide a value for the `github-token` input. This is another good scenario
  for GitHub App authentication!
</Note>

#### Validate transition failure

If the validation fails, the issue is updated with a comment that includes the
validation errors. The issue is then transitioned back to the `Created` state.
When the user updates the issue body, it will be parsed and validated again.

```markdown
:no_entry: There were errors validating the issue body:

- Error message
```

#### Validate transition success

If the validation is successful, the issue is updated with a relevant comment.
At this point, the issue is transitioned to the `Validated` state.

```markdown
:tada: Issue validated successfully!
```
