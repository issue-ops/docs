## Definition

The `Created` state is the initial state for a new issue that has been opened.
It is the first state in the lifecycle of an issue.

## Example transitions

### Parse

When a new issue is opened, before any action can be taken on it, you should
parse the contents of the issue body and turn it into a machine readable format.
The [`issue-ops/parser`](https://github.com/issue-ops/parser) action does this
by comparing the body of the issue with the issue form template that was used to
create it.

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Parse Issue
    id: parser
    uses: issue-ops/parser@vX.X.X
    with:
      body: ${{ github.event.issue.body }}
      issue-form-template: my-template.yml
```

Based on the issue form template, the body of the issue will be parsed into JSON
that can be read in subsequent steps. For example:

```json
{
  "the_name_of_the_thing": "this-thing",
  "the_nickname_of_the_thing": "thing",
  "the_color_of_the_thing": ["blue"],
  "the_shape_of_the_thing": ["square"],
  "the_sounds_of_the_thing": ["re", "mi"],
  "the_topics_about_the_thing": [],
  "the_description_of_the_thing": "This is a description.\n\nIt has lines.",
  "the_notes_about_the_thing": "- Note\n- Another note\n- Lots of notes",
  "the_code_of_the_thing": "const thing = new Thing()\n\nthing.doThing()",
  "the_string_method_of_the_code_of_the_thing": "thing.toString()",
  "is_the_thing_a_thing": {
    "selected": ["Yes"],
    "unselected": ["No"]
  },
  "is_the_thing_useful": {
    "selected": ["Sometimes"],
    "unselected": ["Yes", "No"]
  },
  "read_team": "IssueOps-Demo-Readers",
  "write_team": "IssueOps-Demo-Writers"
}
```
