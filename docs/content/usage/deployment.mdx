When you build your Doctocat site using
[`gatsby build`](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-cli/#build), the output is
static content: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc. Static content is incredibly
easy and affordable to host with any deployment solution. We have landed on
using [Now](https://zeit.co/now) for our deploys.

## Deploying to Now

If you started with the
[Doctocat template](https://github.com/primer/doctocat-template), your site is
already configured to deploy with Now. You're ready to set up the
[Now for GitHub](https://zeit.co/github) integration. If you did not start with
the Doctocat template, before you set up the Now for Github integration, you'll
need to create a `now.json` file and add a `now-build` script to `package.json`:

```json
// now.json
{
  "version": 2,
  "name": "my-site",
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "package.json",
      "use": "@now/static-build",
      "config": { "distDir": "public" }
    }
  ]
}
```

```json
// package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    ...
    "build": "gatsby build",
    "now-build": "npm run build"
  }
}
```

Once your site has the necessary configuration files and scripts, you can enable
the Now for GitHub integration. You'll need to create a Now account, connect
your GitHub account, then enable the integration for your repository. Check out
the [Now for GitHub docs](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/integrations/now-for-github/)
for more detailed instructions.

After you have the GitHub integration set up, you should be able to access your
site from a prefixed `.now.sh` domain.

## Deploying to other providers

[Deploying and Hosting](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/deploying-and-hosting/)
guides for more information about deploying to other providers.

## Adding a primer.style path alias

### 1. Update gatsby-config.js

To make your site available from `primer.style/my-site`, start by setting a
[`pathPrefix`](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/path-prefix/) in your
`gatsby-config.js`:

```diff
// gatsby-config.js
module.exports = {
+ pathPrefix: '/my-site',
}
```

### 2. Update package.json

Next, make sure your `build` script in `package.json` runs `gatsby build` with
the `--prefix-paths` flag:

```diff
// package.json
{
  "scripts": {
-   "build": "gatsby build",
+   "build": "gatsby build --prefix-paths",
    "now-build": "npm run build"
  }
}
```

If this flag is not set, Gatsby will ignore your `pathPrefix`.

### 3. Update now.json

The `--prefix-paths` flag tells Gatsby to prefix paths used in the
[`Link`](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-link/) component and
[`navigate`](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-link/#how-to-use-the-navigate-helper-function)
helper with the `pathPrefix` value assigned in your `gatsby-config.js` file.
However, `--prefix-paths` doesn't change where built files get stored in the
build directory. This creates a mismatch between the links on your site and the
actual paths to your files.

To fix this issue, you'll need to define a
[route](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/advanced/routes) in your `now.json` file that
proxies `/my-site/*` to `/*` so that behind the scenes a path like
`/my-site/getting-started` will find `/getting-started.html` in your build
directory:

```json
// now.json
{
  ...
  "routes": [
    {"src": "/my-site(/.*)?", "dest": "$1"},
  ]
}
```

If your site is located in a subdirectory, make sure the destination (`dest`) of
your proxy route is the path to that subdirectory followed by `$1`. Here's what
your `now.json` file might look like if your site is located in a subdirectory
called `docs`:

```json
// now.json
{
  ...
  "routes": [
    {"src": "/my-site(/.*)?", "dest": "/docs$1"},
  ]
}
```

In order to route branch deploys correctly, you'll also need to set up a route
that redirects root route requests (`my-site.now.sh`) to your path prefix
(`my-site.now.sh/my-site`):

```diff
// now.json
{
  ...
  "routes": [
    {"src": "/my-site(/.*)?", "dest": "/docs$1"},
+   {
+     "src": "/",
+     "status": 301,
+     "headers": {"Location": "/my-site"}
+   }
  ]
}
```

This is necessary because when your project lives in a subdirectory, there isn't
any content for the site in the root of your deploy.

### 4. Update now.json in primer/primer.style

After everything is set up in your repository, open a pull request on the
[primer/primer.style](https://github.com/primer/primer.style) repository to add
your site to the `routes` list in
[now.json](https://github.com/primer/primer.style/blob/master/now.json):

```diff
// now.json in primer/primer.style
{
  "routes": [
    {"src": "/components(/.*)?", "dest": "https://primer-components.now.sh"},
    {"src": "/css(/.*)?", "dest": "https://primer-css.now.sh"},
    {"src": "/design(/.*)?", "dest": "https://primer-design.now.sh"},
    {"src": "/blueprints(/.*)?", "dest": "https://primer-blueprints.now.sh"},
    {"src": "/presentations(/.*)?", "dest": "https://primer-presentations.now.sh"},
+   {"src": "/my-site(/.*)?", "dest": "https://my-site.now.sh"}
  ]
}
```

Once your pull request is approved and merged, you'll be able to access your
site from `primer.style/my-site`. ðŸŽ‰
