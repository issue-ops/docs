title: Using images
---

export { Layout as default } from '@issue-ops/gatsby-theme-doctocat-typescript'

To use images in your Doctocat site:

1. Add an `images` folder in the root of your docs site
1. Add any images you'd like to use in the `images` folder
1. In the file you'd like to use an image in, import the image using a relative
   path:

```
import DemoImage from '../images/demo-image.png'
```

4. Then use that image name as the `src` value in an img tag:

```
<ImageContainer>
  <img src={DemoImage} alt="a description of your image"/>
</ImageContainer>
```

Make sure to use the `alt` attribute to describe your image for assistive
technology, or use the [`Caption` component](/components/caption)

If you run into any problems with Gatsby building the site and not being able to
find your image path try the following:

1. Double check that the path is correct
2. Try deleting the `./cache` folder and rebuilding
