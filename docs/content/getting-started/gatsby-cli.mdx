Follow these steps to create a new site using the
[Gatsby CLI](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-cli/):

<Note>

This guide assumes that you have some familiarity with the command line, and
have Node.js and npm installed locally. Check out
[nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) for more information. You will need npm v5.2.0
or higher to use the
[`npx`](https://blog.npmjs.org/post/162869356040/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner)
command in step 1.

</Note>

## 1. Scaffold a new site

Use the Gatsby CLI and the Doctocat starter to scaffold a new site:

```shell
npx gatsby new my-site https://github.com/primer/doctocat-starter
```

`my-site` is an arbitrary title — you can pick anything. Running the above
command will place the code for your new site in a new directory called
“my-site”. If you want to create a new site in an existing repository, be sure
to run the `gatsby new` command from within that repository.

## 2. Navigate into the site directory

Navigate into the newly created site directory using `cd`:

```shell
cd my-site
```

Check out the [getting started guide](/getting-started) for more information
about the important files and subdirectories in your new site directory.

## 3. Start the development server

Use the `develop` npm script to start Gatsby's hot-reloading development
environment:

```shell
npm run develop
```

To view your site locally, navigate to http://localhost:8000 in your browser.
Each page of the site corresponds to a file in the `content` directory. Navigate
to any page then try editing the corresponding MDX file. You should see the page
update in real time.
