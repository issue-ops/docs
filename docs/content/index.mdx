If you landed on this page, you're probably trying to find the answer to the
question _"What is IssueOps?"_ If so, you came to the right place! The goal of
this site is to provide education, best practices, examples, and resources for
building IssueOps workflows on GitHub.

<Alert severity="info">
  This site is a work in progress. If you have any feedback, please [open an
  issue](https://github.com/issue-ops/docs/issues/new)! If you're interested in

## What is IssueOps?

IssueOps is a loose collection of tools, workflows, and concepts that can be
applied to [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/features/issues) to drive a nearly
limitless number of workflows. Like many of the other "Ops" tools, (ChatOps,
GitOps, and so on), IssueOps leverages a friendly interface to drive automation
behind-the-scenes. In this case, issues and pull requests (PRs) are the
interface, and GitHub Actions is the automation engine.

IssueOps isn't just a DevOps tool! You can run anything from complex CI/CD
pipelines to a bed and breakfast reservation system. If you can interact with it
via an API, there's a good chance you can build it with IssueOps :wink:

## Why should I use IssueOps?

### <ZapIcon size={24} /> Event-driven

Any time a user interacts with an issue or PR, an event is triggered. These
events can be used to trigger GitHub Actions workflows.

### <PencilIcon size={24} /> Customizable

Based on the event type and data provided, you can implement custom logic to
perform virtually any task. If you can interact with it via an API, command-line
tool, or script, you can probably build it with IssueOps.

### <SearchIcon size={24} /> Transparent

All actions taken on an issue are recorded in the issue timeline.

### <LockIcon size={24} /> Immutable

An issue or pull request creates an immutable record of the transaction,
approvals, and actions that are taken. This follows GitHub's _"everything has a
URL"_ philosophy.

## How do I get started?
