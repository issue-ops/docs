## GitHub Actions workflows

The IssueOps model makes heavy use of the `issue` and `issue_comment` triggers
in GitHub Actions workflows.

```yaml
on:
  issue_comment:
    types:
      - created
```

These triggers will only act on workflow files in the _default_ branch of your
repository. This means that pull requests cannot introduce changes to your
IssueOps workflows that would be run as part of that PR (e.g. creating a
workflow that dumps secrets to the logs). Any changes to the workflow files can
be protected with branch protection rules to ensure only verified changes make
it into your default branch.

## Workflow permissions

To further harden your workflow files, you should always restrict them to the
base permissions needed to run. For information about the available permissions,
see
[Assigning permissions to jobs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/assigning-permissions-to-jobs).

<Note>
  Permissions can be assigned for the entire workflow, as well as for individual
  jobs. If one job needs additional permissions, make sure to scope them to that
  job only.
