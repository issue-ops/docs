### Title

The title of an issue should be descriptive and concise. It should be easy to

### Body

This can be entered directly by the user, or you can enforce a desired format
using issue forms. Issue forms will help you enforce a standard format that is
easy to parse and validate.

### Assignees

### Labels

Labels are a great way to control the flow of an issue through the state(s)
you've defined. Any time a issue is commented on or updated, you can use labels
to tell where in the flow it is currently, and where it needs to go next.

### Milestones

### Relations

### Development

### Projects

### Participants

### Timeline

### Comments

Other than the issue body, comments are how a user will drive your IssueOps
flow. You should define keywords that your workflow looks for to trigger certain
actions. Suppose you have a workflow where a user can create a new repository.
After the issue has been validated, the user can comment on the issue with a
keyword such as “.submit” to trigger the creation of their repo.

You can also use them to communicate information back to the user. For example,
if the issue body contains invalid or incorrect information, you can reply to
the issue stating what needs to be corrected. For example, in the screenshot,
you can see that a comment was added to the issue because the request was
missing information.

### Reactions

Though they don't convey as much information as a comment, adding reactions to
issues and comments are a nice way to let the user know that their input has
been received and is being processed. If needed, you can follow up with a
comment when processing is complete.

## Pull requests

In a pull request, there are a couple additional features that can be used:

### Reviews and Approvals

Currently, issues don't include an approval functionality. If you want to
implement this in an issue, you will need to do so using comments.

In a PR, however, you can define specific users or teams that need to approve a
request before it is completed.
