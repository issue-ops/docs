This page outlines recommended configuration settings for IssueOps repositories.
For instructions on how to create a repository, see the
[GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo).

## Visibility

IssueOps works best when your repository is accessible to users who need to
submit requests. Depending on if the repository is owned by an organization or a
user account, you can set the visibility to one of the following:

| Owner        | Visibility             |
| ------------ | ---------------------- |
| Organization | `public` or `internal` |
| User         | `public`               |

Alternatively, if you only want to allow specific users to submit requests, you
can set the visibility to `private` and add those users as
[collaborators](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-access-to-your-personal-repositories/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository).

## Permissions

Users only need `read` access to create issues! Unless there is a specific
reason to do otherwise, you should only ever need to grant `read` access.

The primary reason to grant `write` access is if your IssueOps flow uses pull
requests instead of issues, but only if you want users to create pull requests
from branches in the _same_ repository. As an alternative, you can allow forking
of your repository and users can create pull requests from their forked
repository instead.

## Branch protection

[Branch protection rules](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/about-protected-branches)
are a good idea regardless of what your repository is being used for! You should
always protect your default branch (usually `main`) and any other branches that
you want to prevent accidental changes to.

For an IssueOps repository, you should create a branch protection rule for
`main` that enables the following:

- Require a pull request before merging
- Require status checks to pass before merging (add any continuous integration
  or testing workflows that you use)
- Require branches to be up to date before merging
- Require review from Code Owners (if your repository has a `CODEOWNERS` file)

## GitHub Actions

### Fork pull request workflows

If your IssueOps workflow uses pull requests instead of issues, you must be
careful about the configuration of GitHub Actions and what permissions are
allowed for fork pull requests. The following settings can be enabled for fork
pull requests, with a description of the risks involved.

| Setting                                                         | Risk                                                            |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Run workflows from fork pull requests                           | Forks will have read permissions to your repository             |
| Send write tokens to workflows from fork pull requests          | Forks will have **write** permissions to your repository        |
| Send secrets and variables to workflows from fork pull requests | Forks will have access to your secrets and variables            |
| Require approval for fork pull request workflows                | Forks will not be able to run workflows until they are approved |

As you can guess, the safest option is to not allow fork pull requests to run
workflows at all. However, this may not be practical for your workflow. Here are
some recommended settings:

<DoDontContainer>
  <Dont indented>Send write tokens to fork pull requests</Dont>
  <Do indented>
    Document required permissions for contributors to run the workflows
    themselves
  </Do>
</DoDontContainer>

<DoDontContainer>
  <Dont indented>
    Send secrets and variables to workflows from fork pull requests
  </Dont>
  <Do indented>
    Document the required secrets and variables and how to generate them
  </Do>
</DoDontContainer>

One alternative to consider is to "wrap" the creation of the PR into part of
your IssueOps flow. If the content of the PR will follow a known format, you can
use a GitHub Action to create the PR on behalf of the user. This will allow you
to remove the need to allow any GitHub Actions access to fork pull requests. For
an example of this scenario, see the
[IssueOps Actions](/reference/issueops-actions) page.

### Workflow permissions

In the repository settings, it is best to keep the base workflow permissions
limited to _Read repository contents and packages permissions_. Within each
IssueOps workflow, you can increase the permissions as needed for specific jobs.

## Environments

If your IssueOps workflow involves deployments or interaction with environments,
you should consider adding enviroment-specific rules to restrict deployments to
only the `main` branch. A common exception to this rule is if you are running
IssueOps workflows from pull requests, as these will be run from branches other
than `main`.

This is also a good opportunity to further restrict access to secrets and
variables by defining them at the environment level!

## Other considerations

A few common questions and answers about repository setup. Most of the time, the
answer is "it depends!", but these are some things to consider.

### Multiple IssueOps workflows in one repository

There are some tradeoffs to consider when using one or multiple repositories to
host different IssueOps workflows. For example, suppose you have the following
workflows:

- Team membership requests
- New repository creation requests

If you use a single repository, one challenge you may run into is ensuring that
jobs for the team membership requests don't affect new repository requests. This
is where labels are particularly helpful! You can use labels to scope jobs to
specific requests.

```yaml
name: Issue Opened/Edited

on:
  issues:
    types:
      - opened
      - edited

jobs:
  new-repo-request:
    name: New Repo Request
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Only run for issues with the `issueops:new-repo-request` label.
    if: contains(github.event.issue.labels.*.name, 'issueops:new-repo')

  team-membership-request:
    name: Team Membership Request
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Only run for issues with the `issueops:team-add` label.
    if: contains(github.event.issue.labels.*.name, 'issueops:team-add')
```
