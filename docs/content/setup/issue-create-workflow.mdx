Once a user submits your issue form, its time for GitHub Actions to run the
show! The create workflow is responsible for performing any initial processing
of the issue, such as adding labels, validating the contents, adding comments,
etc.

The following sections will walk through the core structure of a create
workflow. For more detailed information, refer to the
[Created state](/states/created) documentation.

## Event triggers

The term "create workflow" is a misnomer. This workflow should, at minimum, be
run any time an issue is opened, edited, or reopened. However, most of the time
this workflow will only be run when an issue is created.

```yaml
on:
  issues:
    types:
      - opened
      - edited
      - reopened
```

## Jobs

Different request types may have different inputs. For example, a new repository
request may have different inputs than a repository transfer request. If you
decide to create multiple jobs to parse different types of requests in the same
workflow, you can use labels to control which jobs run for which types of
requests.

You should also consider how you plan to handle processing of multiple requests
in the same workflow.

```yaml
jobs:
  new-repository-request:
    name: New Repository Request
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Only run for issues with the `issueops:new-repository` label.
    if: contains(github.event.issue.labels.*.name, 'issueops:new-repository')

  team-membership-request:
    name: Team Membership Request
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Only run for issues with the `issueops:team-add` label.
    if: contains(github.event.issue.labels.*.name, 'issueops:team-add')
```

Depending on the complexity of your workflow, you may want to isolate each type
of request to separate jobs entirely, or you may want to have jobs that handle
common tasks across multiple request types. For example, if you have IssueOps
workflows for adding and removing users from a team, there's a good chance they
both have the same input data and perform the same validation steps. In this
case, you may want to create a job that handles the common tasks, and then have
separate jobs for the unique tasks.

```yaml
jobs:
  team-request:
    name: Team Management Request
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Run this job for both request types
    if: |
      contains(github.event.issue.labels.*.name, 'issueops:team-add') ||
      contains(github.event.issue.labels.*.name, 'issueops:team-remove')

    outputs:
      request: ${{ steps.parse.outputs.json }}

    steps:
      - name: Parse Issue
        id: parse
        uses: issue-ops/parser@vX.X.X
        with:
          body: ${{ github.event.issue.body }}
          issue-form-template: team-add-remove-request.yml

      - name: Validate Issue
        id: validate
        uses: issue-ops/validator@vX.X.X
        with:
          issue-form-template: team-add-remove-request.yml
          parsed-issue-body: ${{ steps.parse.outputs.json }}

  team-add:
    name: Team Add Request
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Only run after the `team-request` job has completed
    needs: team-request

    # Only run for issues with the `issueops:team-add` label.
    if: contains(github.event.issue.labels.*.name, 'issueops:team-add')

    steps:
      - name: Add User to Team
        id: add
        uses: actions/github-script@v6
        with:
          github-token: ${{ secrets.MY_TOKEN }}
          script: |
            const request = JSON.parse('${{ needs.team-request.outputs.request }}')

            await github.rest.teams.addOrUpdateMembershipForUserInOrg({
              org: request.org,
              team_slug: request.team,
              username: request.user
            })

  team-remove:
    name: Team Remove Request
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Only run after the `team-request` job has completed
    needs: team-request

    # Only run for issues with the `issueops:team-remove` label.
    if: contains(github.event.issue.labels.*.name, 'issueops:team-remove')

    steps:
      - name: Remove User from Team
        id: remove
        uses: actions/github-script@v6
        with:
          github-token: ${{ secrets.MY_TOKEN }}
          script: |
            const request = JSON.parse('${{ needs.team-request.outputs.request }}')

            await github.rest.teams.removeMembershipForUserInOrg({
              org: request.org,
              team_slug: request.team,
              username: request.user
            })
```
