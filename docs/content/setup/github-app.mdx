If your IssueOps workflow requires access to anything outside of the repository
it is running in, you will need to provide it with a token. This token is used
to authenticate with the GitHub API and should be scoped to the minimum
permissions needed to do the job. Tokens can be provided two ways:

- [Personal access tokens (PAT)](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens)
- [GitHub App installation tokens](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/authenticating-with-a-github-app/authenticating-as-a-github-app-installation)

Since PATs are scoped to a single user, they are not recommended for use in
IssueOps workflows. GitHub Apps are a better choice because they can be scoped
to a repository or organization to provide access to the APIs you need.

<Alert severity="warning">
  GitHub Apps cannot currently be created at the enterprise level for access to
  administrative APIs. If you need access to these APIs, you will need to use a
  PAT. In these cases, creating a "machine user" account is recommended over a
  personal account.
</Alert>

## Ownership

When creating a GitHub App, you have the option to specify your personal account
or an organization as the owner. Choosing an organization as the owner allows
you to grant access to multiple repositories in the organization and simplifies
permissions management.

## Setup

### Create a GitHub App

For instructions on how to create a GitHub App, see
[Creating GitHub Apps](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/about-creating-github-apps/about-creating-github-apps).

The following settings are a good starting point for IssueOps workflows:

<TableContainer component={Paper}>
  <Table>
    <TableHead>
      <TableRow>
        <TableCell>Setting</TableCell>
        <TableCell>Value</TableCell>
      </TableRow>
    </TableHead>
    <TableBody>
      <TableRow>
        <TableCell>Name</TableCell>
        <TableCell>
          A clear name that describes its purpose and permissions
        </TableCell>
      </TableRow>
      <TableRow>
        <TableCell>Description</TableCell>
        <TableCell>
          A description of what the app does and what it can access
        </TableCell>
      </TableRow>
      <TableRow>
        <TableCell>Homepage URL</TableCell>
        <TableCell>The URL to the repository with your IssueOps code</TableCell>
      </TableRow>
      <TableRow>
        <TableCell>Webhook</TableCell>
        <TableCell>Disable webhooks</TableCell>
      </TableRow>
      <TableRow>
        <TableCell>Permissions</TableCell>
        <TableCell>
          Select the **minimum** permissions needed for your workflow
        </TableCell>
      </TableRow>
    </TableBody>
  </Table>
</TableContainer>

### Create a private key

For instructions on how to create a private key, see
[Managing private keys for GitHub Apps](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/authenticating-with-a-github-app/managing-private-keys-for-github-apps).

<Alert severity="error">
  Make sure to save the private key in a secure location!
</Alert>

### Create GitHub Actions secrets

After creating your GitHub App, you will need to create secrets that your
IssueOps workflows can use to authenticate with the GitHub API. You can create
these at the organization, repository, or environment level depending on your
needs.

You will need to create the following secrets. Make sure to note the names you
give them as you will need to reference them in your workflows.

<TableContainer component={Paper}>
  <Table>
    <TableHead>
      <TableRow>
        <TableCell>Name</TableCell>
        <TableCell>Description</TableCell>
      </TableRow>
    </TableHead>
    <TableBody>
      <TableRow>
        <TableCell>App ID</TableCell>
        <TableCell>The ID of your GitHub App</TableCell>
      </TableRow>
      <TableRow>
        <TableCell>Private Key</TableCell>
        <TableCell>The private key you created</TableCell>
      </TableRow>
    </TableBody>
  </Table>
</TableContainer>

<br />

<Alert severity="info">
  The GitHub App ID is not a sensitive value and can be stored as a variable
  instead of a secret. It can be found on the settings page for your GitHub App.
</Alert>

For instructions on how to create secrets, see the following links:

- [Creating secrets for a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions#creating-secrets-for-a-repository)
- [Creating secrets for an environment](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions#creating-secrets-for-an-environment)
- [Creating secrets for an organization](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions#creating-secrets-for-an-organization)

## Usage

### Update the workflow permissions

In any workflow that needs to authenticate as a GitHub App, the following
permissions **must** be specified at the workflow or job level.

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  id-token: write
```

### Generate the installation access token

There are various examples and open source actions available to create
installation access tokens for GitHub Actions workflows. In this documentation,
we will use the
[`actions/create-github-app-token`](https://github.com/actions/create-github-app-token)
action.

Within any workflow job that needs to authenticate as your GitHub App, you will
need to include the following step.

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: actions/create-github-app-token@vX.X.X
    id: token
    with:
      app_id: ${{ secrets.MY_GITHUB_APP_ID }}
      private_key: ${{ secrets.MY_GITHUB_APP_PEM }}
      owner: ${{ github.repository_owner }}
```

Make sure to update the following:

- Set the version (`vX.X.X`) of the action to the latest published version.
- Update the secret names to match the ones you created previously.

<Alert severity="info">
  In the previous example, the `owner` property is set to the owner of the
  repository where this workflow is defined. If your GitHub App is installed
  under another owner, you will need to specify that instead.
</Alert>

### Use the token in your workflow

Now that the token is being generated, you can reference it in your workflows as
an output from the token generation step! This can be referenced as
`${{ steps.<step-id>.outputs.token }}` (e.g.
`${{ steps.token.outputs.token }}`).

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: actions/github-script@vX.X.X
    id: create-org-project
    with:
      github-token: ${{ steps.token.outputs.token }}
      script: |
        await github.rest.projects.createForOrg({
          org: 'octo-org',
          name: 'My awesome project'
        })
```

<Alert severity="warning">
  Make sure to check which steps in your workflow will need to use the GitHub
  App token versus the workflow token. For example, if you add the `issues:
  write` permission to your workflow, you do not need to use the GitHub App
  token to update issues in the _same_ repository as your workflows. However,
  you will need to use the GitHub App token to update issues in _other_
  repositories!
</Alert>

## Example

The following can be used as a starting point for your own workflows. Make sure
to update the following information:

```yaml
name: Example Workflow

# This workflow runs any time an issue is opened or edited.
on:
  issues:
    types:
      - opened
      - edited

jobs:
  example-job:
    name: Example Job
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    permissions:
      contents: read
      id-token: write

    steps:
      # Get the GitHub App installation access token.
      - uses: actions/create-github-app-token@vX.X.X
        id: token
        with:
          app_id: ${{ secrets.MY_GITHUB_APP_ID }}
          private_key: ${{ secrets.MY_GITHUB_APP_PEM }}
          owner: ${{ github.repository_owner }}

      - run: echo "Add your custom steps here!"
```
