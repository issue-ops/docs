After the issue has been opened and any initial processing has been run, the
comment workflow becomes the main driver of the rest of the process. This
workflow is triggered by users commenting on issues and will do any further
processing throughout the lifecycle of the issue.

## Event triggers

The comment workflow should, at minimum, be triggered by creation of new
comments. The `issue_comment` trigger also supports editing and deleting
comments, which may be useful for your use-case.

```yaml
on:
  issue_comment:
    - created
```

The flexibility with the `issue_comment` trigger lies in the comments
themselves. You can take a limitless number of actions based on user input!

<Box style={{ alignItems: 'center', textAlign: 'center' }}>
  _With great power comes great responsibility!_
</Box>

Be careful to not make your workflow _too_ complex. Otherwise, parsing comments
becomes particularly challenging.

<Alert severity="info">
  The `issue_comment` trigger may seem misleading. This trigger applies to
  comments on both issues and PRs. If you want to trigger workflows on comments
  that are part of a PR _review_, use the `pull_request_comment` trigger
  instead.
</Alert>

## Commands

Good IssueOps workflows make use of _commands_ to trigger actions. These
commands are typically prefixed with a symbol, such as `.` or `/`, and are
descriptive of the action that will be taken when the command is processed. In
general, any workflow that involves processing comments should start by looking
for a specific command being run.

<TableContainer component={Paper}>
  <Table>
    <TableHead>
      <TableRow>
        <TableCell>Keyword</TableCell>
        <TableCell>Description</TableCell>
      </TableRow>
    </TableHead>
    <TableBody>
      <TableRow>
        <TableCell>`.submit`</TableCell>
        <TableCell>Submit a request for approval</TableCell>
      </TableRow>
      <TableRow>
        <TableCell>`.approve`</TableCell>
        <TableCell>Approve a request</TableCell>
      </TableRow>
      <TableRow>
        <TableCell>`.deny`</TableCell>
        <TableCell>Deny a request</TableCell>
      </TableRow>
    </TableBody>
  </Table>
</TableContainer>

The examples you will see throughout this documentation make heavy use of the
[`github/command`](https://github.com/github/command) action. This action makes
it easy to define your actions, who can run them, and what happens when they are
run.

The following code block shows a basic implementation of this action as part of
a IssueOps workflow to lint a pull request. In this example, the `Lint Command`
step will run any time a user comments with `.lint` on a PR.

```yaml
name: IssueOps Linter

on:
  issue_comment:
    types:
      - created

jobs:
  lint:
    name: Lint Codebase
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Only run on PR comments, not issue comments
    if: ${{ github.event.pull_request }}

    # Minimum required permissions for the `github/command` action
    permissions:
      pull-requests: write
      issues: write
      checks: read

    steps:
      - name: Lint Command
        id: command
        uses: github/command@vX.X.X
        with:
          command: .lint

      - if: ${{ steps.command.outputs.continue == 'true' }}
        name: Checkout
        id: checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@vX.X.X

      - if: ${{ steps.command.outputs.continue == 'true' }}
        name: Run Linter
        id: run-linter
        run: npm run lint
```

As you can see, the `Checkout` and `Run Linter` steps only proceed if the
`Lint Command` step's `continue` output is `'true'`. The `github/command` action
provides the `continue` output to act as a gate for the rest of the workflow.

The high-level flow of the `github/command` action is:

1. Check the comment body for the command keyword (`.lint`)
1. Add a reaction to the comment to indicate it was received
1. Confirm the command is allowed to run
   1. The user is authorized to run the command
   1. Required checks have passed
   1. Required reviews have been submitted
1. Collect any arguments passed to the command

## Workflow steps

Most comment workflows can be broken down into the following steps. Depending on
your workflow, some of these may not be required.

1. Parse and validate the command and input(s)
1. Parse and validate the issue body
1. Check the current state
1. Check the user's permissions
1. Process the command
1. Update the issue state
1. Provide feedback to the user

### Parse and validate the command and input(s)

Depending on your workflow, you may need users to be able to provide additional
inputs in their comments. For example, you may want to allow users to specify a
specific branch to lint, or a specific file to run tests on. Input arguments can
also be passed into the comment body as part of a command.

The `github/command` action can be extended to support input parameters.
Parameters must be added after the separator specified by the `param_separator`
argument (default: `|`). Suppose you want to also allow users to provide a
branch name to run linting on. Users would enter a comment like this:

```plain
.lint | main
```

Within your workflow, you would need to parse the parameter value and use it to
checkout the correct branch:

```yaml
name: IssueOps Linter

on:
  issue_comment:
    types:
      - created

jobs:
  lint:
    name: Lint Codebase
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Only run on PR comments, not issue comments
    if: ${{ github.event.pull_request }}

    # Minimum required permissions for the `github/command` action
    permissions:
      pull-requests: write
      issues: write
      checks: read

    steps:
      - name: Lint Command
        id: command
        uses: github/command@vX.X.X
        with:
          command: .lint
          param_separator: '|' # This is the default value

      - if: ${{ steps.command.outputs.continue == 'true' }}
        name: Checkout
        id: checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@vX.X.X
        with:
          ref: ${{ steps.command.outputs.params }}

      - if: ${{ steps.command.outputs.continue == 'true' }}
        name: Run Linter
        id: run-linter
        run: npm run lint
```

<Alert severity="warning">
  The `params` output is a string, not an array or object. If you need to pass
  multiple parameters, you will need to include additional logic for parsing the
  string.
</Alert>

### Parse and validate the issue body

<ActionList>
  <ActionList.Item disabled>
    <ActionList.LeadingVisual>
      <CheckCircleIcon size={24} />
    </ActionList.LeadingVisual>
    Validate Early
  </ActionList.Item>
  <ActionList.Item disabled>
    <ActionList.LeadingVisual>
      <CheckCircleIcon size={24} />
    </ActionList.LeadingVisual>
    Validate Often
  </ActionList.Item>
</ActionList>

Any time you interact with an issue, make sure to validate the body! Users can
edit the issue body at any time, so it's important to make sure you're working
with the latest information. The
[`issue-ops/parser`](https://github.com/issue-ops/parser) and
[`issue-ops/validator`](https://github.com/issue-ops/validator) actions can take
care of this for you. All you need to do is make sure they are included in your
comment processing workflows.

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Parse Issue Body
    id: parse
    uses: issue-ops/parser@vX.X.X
    with:
      body: ${{ github.event.issue.body }}
      issue-form-template: my-issue-form.yml

  - name: Validate Issue Body
    id: validate
    uses: issue-ops/validator@vX.X.X
    with:
      issue-form-template: my-issue-form.yml
      issue-number: ${{ github.event.issue.number }}
      parsed-issue-body: ${{ steps.parse.outputs.json }}
```

### Check the current state

As an issue is processed, it will move through a series of [states](/states).
The current state of an issue can be tracked via labels.

For example, suppose you have a workflow that requires users to submit their
request after is has been validated and confirmed. You could use the following
logic to check if the issue has already been submitted. That way, the processing
that would transition the issue from `validated` to `submitted` state does not
run again.

```yaml
# This will only run if the request has already been submitted.
if: contains(github.event.issue.labels.*.name, 'issueops:submitted') == true

steps:
  - name: Post Comment
    id: comment
    uses: peter-evans/create-or-update-comment@vX.X.X
    with:
      issue-number: ${{ github.event.issue.number }}
      body: |
        ':clock1: It looks like this issue has already been submitted. Sit tight!'
```

<Alert severity="info">
  Labels can be edited at any time! You want to consider checking if the state
  indicated by the issue labels matches the expected state of the issue.
</Alert>

### Check the user's permissions

By default, any user with read access to a repository can open issues and add
comments. If your IssueOps workflow involves certain authorized users being able
to perform actions (e.g. approving or denying requests), this can be a problem!
Instead, you should use the `allowlist` option in the `github/command` action to
restrict who has the ability to run certain commands.

For example, suppose you want to only allow certain administrators to approve
requests for new repositories. The following step would only allow @octocat and
@mona to run the `.approve` command. Any other users who comment on the issue
with `.approve` will not be able to push the request through to the next state.

```yaml
- name: Approve Command
  id: approve
  uses: github/command@vX.X.X
  with:
    command: .approve
    allowlist: octocat,mona
```

If you want to use teams to control access, you will also need to provide a
token with `read:org` scope for the `allowlist_pat` property. For information on
creating a GitHub App and using it to generate a token in a GitHub Actions
workflow, see [GitHub App setup](/setup/github-app).

```yaml
- uses: actions/create-github-app-token@vX.X.X
  id: token
  with:
    app_id: ${{ secrets.MY_GITHUB_APP_ID }}
    private_key: ${{ secrets.MY_GITHUB_APP_PEM }}
    owner: ${{ github.repository_owner }}

- name: Approve Command
  id: approve
  uses: github/command@vX.X.X
  with:
    command: .approve
    allowlist: octo-org/admin-team
    allowlist_pat: ${{ steps.token.outputs.token }}
```

Alternatively, you can restrict access to specific roles in your IssueOps
repository using the `permissions` property. By default, anyone with write,
maintain, or administrator access to the repository can run commands.

```yaml
- name: Approve Command
  id: approve
  uses: github/command@vX.X.X
  with:
    command: .approve
    permissions: admin,maintain # Restrict users with write access
```

### Process the command

This is where the magic happens! You can use any series of actions to process
your request. For example, the
[`actions/github-script`](https://github.com/actions/github-script) action is a
great choice for interacting with GitHub APIs.

Make sure to gate these steps using the `continue` output from the
`github/command` action!

```yaml
- if: ${{ steps.command.outputs.continue == 'true' }}
  name: Add User to Team
  id: add-user
  uses: actions/github-script@vX.X.X
  with:
    token: ${{ steps.token.outputs.token }}
    script: |
      const request = JSON.parse('${{ steps.parse.outputs.json }}')

      await github.rest.teams.addOrUpdateMembershipForUserInOrg({
        org: context.repo.owner,
        team_slug: request.team_name,
        username: '${{ github.event.issue.user.login }}',
        role: 'member'
      })
```

### Update the issue state

Once any processing has been completed, the issue can be transitioned to the
next state. This is done by adding or removing labels from the issue.

For example, suppose you have a workflow that requires users to submit their
request after is has been validated and confirmed. You can use the
[`issue-ops/labeler`](https://github.com/issue-ops/labeler) action to transition
the issue from `validated` to `submitted` state.

```yaml
- if: ${{ steps.command.outputs.continue == 'true' }}
  name: Set Submitted State
  id: set-submitted
  uses: issue-ops/labeler@vX.X.X
  with:
    action: add
    issue_number: ${{ github.event.issue.number }}
    labels: |
      issueops:submitted
```

### Provide feedback to the user

Any time processing is done on an issue, its helpful to let users know:

1. The command has been received
1. The command is being processed
1. The outcome of the processing

The `github/command` action takes care of the first part for you. It will
automatically add a reaction to any comments that contain a command.

```yaml
- uses: github/command@vX.X.X
  id: command
  with:
    command: .lint
    reaction: eyes
```

Any of the following reactions can be added:

<TableContainer component={Paper}>
  <Table>
    <TableHead>
      <TableRow>
        <TableCell>Value</TableCell>
        <TableCell>Emoji</TableCell>
      </TableRow>
    </TableHead>
    <TableBody>
      <TableRow>
        <TableCell>`+1`</TableCell>
        <TableCell>:+1:</TableCell>
      </TableRow>
      <TableRow>
        <TableCell>`-1`</TableCell>
        <TableCell>:-1:</TableCell>
      </TableRow>
      <TableRow>
        <TableCell>`laugh`</TableCell>
        <TableCell>:smile:</TableCell>
      </TableRow>
      <TableRow>
        <TableCell>`confused`</TableCell>
        <TableCell>:confused:</TableCell>
      </TableRow>
      <TableRow>
        <TableCell>`heart`</TableCell>
        <TableCell>:heart:</TableCell>
      </TableRow>
      <TableRow>
        <TableCell>`hooray`</TableCell>
        <TableCell>:tada:</TableCell>
      </TableRow>
      <TableRow>
        <TableCell>`rocket`</TableCell>
        <TableCell>:rocket:</TableCell>
      </TableRow>
      <TableRow>
        <TableCell>`eyes`</TableCell>
        <TableCell>:eyes:</TableCell>
      </TableRow>
    </TableBody>
  </Table>
</TableContainer>

After the command has been received, adding comments to the issue to indicate
work is being done is a great way to keep users informed. Once processing is
complete, a comment can be added to the issue to indicate the outcome.

```yaml
- if: ${{ steps.command.outputs.continue == 'true' }}
  name: Add Complete Comment
  id: comment-complete
  uses: peter-evans/create-or-update-comment@vX.X.X
  with:
    issue-number: ${{ github.event.issue.number }}
    body: |
      Your request has been processed! Here are the details of the request:

      - **Team:** ${{ steps.parse.outputs.json.team_name }}
      - **Role:** `member`
```
