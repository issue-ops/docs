      <p>
        In the <code>Denied</code> state, we know that the issue has been denied
        and there is no further action to take. This is one of the first states
        in the workflow where we can perform an <i>unguarded transition</i>.
      </p>

      <p>
        In our repository workflow, a request is transitioned to the{' '}
        <code>Denied</code>
        state when an authorized user comments on the request with{' '}
        <code>.deny</code>. However, immediately after reaching this state, we
        want to close the issue (moving it to the <code>Closed</code> state).
        This is called an <i>unguarded transition</i> because there is no
        condition that must be met before the transition occurs.
      </p>

      <p>
        The actual implementation of this transition is up to you! There are a
        few recommendations to keep in mind:
      </p>

      <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
        <li>
          Communication to users is always helpful! Consider leaving a comment
          on the issue to let the user know that their request has been denied
          and what steps, if any, they can take next.
        </li>
        <li>
          Even after an issue is closed, users can interact with it. If you want
          to prevent this, you can{' '}
          <Link
            href="https://docs.github.com/en/communities/moderating-comments-and-conversations/locking-conversations"
            className="text-blue-500 hover:underline">
            lock the issue
          </Link>
          .
        </li>
        <li>
          Labels are a great way to organize issues. Consider adding a label to
          the issue to indicate that it has been denied.
        </li>
        <li>
          When closing an issue, choosing an appropriate reason is useful for
          future reporting. For denied requests, closing an issue as{' '}
          <code>completed</code> may be misleading. Consider{' '}
          <code>not_planned</code> instead.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold">New repository request</h1>

      <p>
        When a new repository request is denied, we want to close the issue and
        leave a comment for the user. We should also add an appropriate label so
        we know the request was closed as denied.
