      <span>
        In GitHub, a pull request (PR) can be interacted with in a lot of the
        same ways as an issue. For example, the{' '}
        <Link
          href="https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/rest/issues/issues?apiVersion=2022-11-28#list-repository-issues"
          className="text-blue-500 hover:underline">
          List repository issues
        </Link>{' '}
        REST API will return both issues and PRs for a repository.
      </span>

      <span>
        This means that many of the features of an issue are applicable to a PR.
        However, PRs have some extra functionality that can also be used in an
        IssueOps workflow. Depending on the use-case, you might want to select
        one over the other. For example, if you want to use the review and
        approval functionality for changes to repository contents, you&apos;ll
        need to use a PR. If you want to use the{' '}

      <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold">State Diagrams</h1>

      <span>
        The following sections contain definitions and examples of common terms
        used in state diagrams. These terms are used throughout this
        documentation.
      </span>

      <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold">Action</h1>

      <span>An atomic task that is performed when a transition is taken.</span>

      <span>
        A condition that is evaluated when a trigger event occurs. A transition
        is taken only if all associated guard conditions are met.

      <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold">State</h1>

      <span>
        A point in an object&apos;s lifecycle that satisfies certain
        condition(s).

      <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold">Transition</h1>

      <span>
        A link between two states that, when traversed by an object, will cause
        certain action(s) to be performed.
      </span>

      <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold">IssueOps workflow</h1>

      <span>
        In general, an IssueOps workflow will follow the same basic pattern:
      </span>

      <span>
        <ol className="list-decimal list-inside">
          <li>
            A user opens an issue and provides information about a request
          </li>
          <li>
            The issue is validated to ensure it contains the required
            information
          </li>
          <li>
            (Optional) Approval is requested from an authorized user or team
          </li>
          <li>The request is processed and the issue is closed</li>
        </ol>
      </span>

      <span>Let&apos;s use a more practical example...</span>

      <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold">Example: GitHub team membership</h1>

      <span>
        <b>
          <i>User Story:</i>
        </b>{' '}
        As a developer, I should be able to request membership to various teams
        and, if approved by administrators, be granted membership.
      </span>

      <span>
        Suppose you are an admin of an organization and would like to reduce the
        overhead of managing team membership. You can use IssueOps to build an
        automated membership request and approval process.
      </span>

      <span>
        We can assume the current, manual workflow looks something like this
        when rendered as a state diagram.
      </span>

      <Alert>
        <IssueOpenedIcon className="h-4 w-4" />
        <AlertTitle>Nodes</AlertTitle>
        <AlertDescription>
          In state diagram format, nodes represent the state of an object (the
          membership request), while transitions represent actions that are
          taken as the object changes state.

      <span>
        When creating an IssueOps workflow, you can use this diagram as a
        starting point to determine what events should trigger state changes,
        how to represent those events in issues, and what actions to take in
        response to state changes.
      </span>

      <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold">Event triggers</h1>

      <span>
        In the membership request workflow, there are several events that
        trigger a change in the request state:
      </span>

      <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
        <li>A user submits a request</li>
        <li>An admin approves a request</li>
        <li>An admin denies a request</li>
        <li>A user is added to a team</li>
        <li>A user is notified</li>
      </ul>

      <span>
        In GitHub, there are many ways to trigger events. For a full list, see{' '}
        <Link

          className="text-blue-500 hover:underline">
          Events that trigger workflows

        . Here, we will focus on the events that are most relevant to IssueOps.
      </span>

      <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold">Issues</h1>

      <span>
        Events related to issues seem like a good fit for <i>Issue</i>Ops!
        Issues are the entrypoint to the worflow. In particular, the issue being
        <i>opened</i>. You can think of this as someone coming to you and saying
        <i>Can you add me to this team?</i> Until this event occurs,
        there&apos;s nothing to do!

      <span>
        However, this is not the only issue event that can be used in a
        workflow. The following table lists other{' '}

      <span>
        After an issue is opened, other events must take place that change the
        state and drive it through the workflow. In the membership request
        workflow, for example, commenting on an issue is a great way to handle
        state changes such as an administrator approving or denying the request.

        <AlertDescription>
          A core difference between issues and PRs is that issues do not have a
          built-in approval process. However, this can be implemented using
          issue comments. For more information, see{' '}

      <span>
        In all three cases, the <i>context</i> of the comment should be taken
        into account to determine how to transition the request state. For
        example, if only authorized administrators are allowed to approve team
        membership requests, how should an IssueOps workflow react if someone
        else comments with approval?

        if any. In our team membership workflow, we can get the user that
        created the comment using the{' '}

        this to determine if the user is authorized to approve the request.

      <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold">Labels</h1>

      <span>
        Labels are a great way to track the state of a request. You can think of
        these as the nodes in a state diagram, while the transitions are the
        actions that are taken as the request changes state. You can also use
        labels to classify the types of requests when your repository supports
        more than one IssueOps workflow. For example, in the membership request
        workflow, you might have the following labels:
      </span>

      <TableContainer component={Paper}>
        <Table>
          <TableHead>
            <TableRow>
              <TableCell>Label</TableCell>
              <TableCell>Description</TableCell>
            </TableRow>
          </TableHead>
          <TableBody>
            <TableRow>
              <TableCell>
                <code style={{ color: 'black' }}>team-membership-request</code>
              </TableCell>
              <TableCell>The type of request</TableCell>
            </TableRow>
            <TableRow>
              <TableCell>
                <code style={{ color: 'black' }}>submitted</code>
              </TableCell>
              <TableCell>
                Requests that have been submitted and are pending review
              </TableCell>
            </TableRow>
          </TableBody>
        </Table>
      </TableContainer>

      <span>
        Looking at this list, you may ask{' '}
        <i>
          why there aren&apos;t labels for <code>approved</code>,{' '}
          <code>denied</code>, or <code>closed</code> states?
        </i>{' '}
        These states don&apos;t have any transitions that do not lead to the
        issue being closed. In other words, once a request is approved or
        denied, the issue will <b>always</b> reach the <code>closed</code>{' '}
        state, regardless of whether it was approved or denied. If this workflow
        had more steps, such as requiring multiple approvals, additional states
        would need to be tracked.

      <span>
        As with <code>issue_comment</code> events, there are only three{' '}

        <li>
          <code>deleted</code>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <span>
        These, however, refer to the actual creation and modification of the
        label itself, so they may not apply to your workflow. You will generally
        use the <code>issue {'=>'} labeled</code> event instead.

      <span>
        One of the most important things to consider when creating workflows
        that interact with the GitHub APIs is permissions. GitHub Actions
        workflows can only interact with the repository in which they run. For
        example, the default permissions do not allow GitHub Actions to manage
        team membership. If you are building a workflow that interacts with
        resources outside of the repository it is running in, you should
        consider creating an organization-level{' '}

        and installing it in your IssueOps repository. That way, you can use the
        permissions of the app to interact with other resources in your
        organization.
