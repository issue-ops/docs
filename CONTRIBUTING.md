## Theme

This repository uses [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), along with the
following themes and components:

- [Primer Design System](https://primer.style/design/)
- [Primer React](https://primer.style/react/)
- [Doctocat](https://primer.style/doctocat/)

A modified version of the Doctocat theme is used to build the documentation from
`.mdx` files in the `docs` directory. Make sure to check out the above links to
get familiarized with Gatsby, Primer, and React :smile:
